# NMapWorld Changelog

### Note

Earlier there were no changelog at all and we have introduced one now and we will start from version 1.0.0. However, keep in mind that this is far from being first version as there have been dozens of commits.

### 1.0.0 - 26.01.2021

* Fixed dataTables
* Added new dataTable variations

This version is tested but we would recommend not to use it in production right away. Please install it for testing purposes and report back if there are any problems to be fixed.
